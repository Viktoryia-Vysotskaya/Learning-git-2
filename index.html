    <h1>Taarlo</h1>
    <p><span>by Herman De Coninck</span></p>
    <p>We walk, the two of us, through the autumn day.<br>And in spring too I feel no different.<br>We walk through much brown tavern-brown of leaves<br>through much dark-red loss, appellation control√©e,</p>
    <p>that deepens in the cellar of the years.<br>We walk through the beiger-turning woods of Drente.<br>Hear the wind passing through the hennaed trees<br>sounding like an oboe, tramp among instruments.</p>
    <p>33, and in the midst of the dark wood<br>of life. And with a sense of nowhere belonging,<br>at home in the woods and desolate at home.</p>
    <p>Will we one day, maybe, ever?<br>The summer is past, the hay-making is over.<br>The here is nowhere, and the now is never.</p>
    <p><span>Translation: 1980, Tanis Guest<br>From: The Low Countries<br>Publisher: Ons Erfdeel, Rekkem, 1997</span></p>
